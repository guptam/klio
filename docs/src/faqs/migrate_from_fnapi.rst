How Do I Migrate from ``setup.py`` to FnAPI?
============================================

The FnAPI (pronounced "fun API") is what allows Klio to use custom Docker images
on Dataflow workers.
However, it's still considered experimental.
The fully-supported way to run a job that has dependencies
(both Python and OS-level dependencies) is via `setup.py <https://beam.apache.org/documentation/
sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies>`_.

Below describes what changes need to be made to an existing job to move from
``setup.py`` to FnAPI.

Creating a new Klio job that does not use ``setup.py`` from the start via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ klio job create --use-fnapi true

Note that this command above will create a job that uses FnAPI for packaging - you will not
need to follow any of the steps below. The steps below convert a job that uses ``setup.py`` for
packaging to one that uses FnAPI.

Required Setup/Changes
----------------------

Update: ``klio-job.yaml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under ``pipeline_options``:

1. **DELETE** the key ``setup_file``.
2. **ADD** the list key ``experiments`` under ``pipeline_options``, containing the item ``beam_fn_api``. Using the ``beam_fn_api`` experiment in conjunction with setting the ``worker_harness_container_image`` tells Klio and Dataflow to use FnAPI rather than the setup file to package the job.

.. collapsible:: Minimal Example ``klio-job.yaml``

    .. code-block:: yaml

        job_name: my-job
        pipeline_options:
          # NOTE! setup_file is absent
          experiments:
            - beam_fn_api
          worker_harness_container_image: gcr.io/my-project/my-job-image
          runner: DataflowRunner
          # <-- snip -->


Update: ``Dockerfile``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. **MOVE** the ``COPY`` line that copies ``job-requirements.txt`` into the image ahead of the rest of the lines that copy in Python files.

2. **UPDATE**  ``RUN pip install .`` to ``RUN pip install -r job-requirements.txt``

.. collapsible:: Why is this needed?

    We now install dependencies directly on the worker image.

3. **MOVE**  ``RUN pip install -r job-requirements.txt`` to the line right after the one from step 1, that copies in ``job-requirements.txt``.

.. collapsible:: Why is this needed?

    This is done as an image build optimization - since your job's Python files are more likely to change than the dependencies in `job-requirements.txt`, it is more efficient install them first.

4. **ADD** any system-level dependencies using ``RUN apt-get update && apt-get install ...``.

.. collapsible:: Why is this needed?

    These dependencies were previously installed through specifying them in ``setup.py`` and running ``pip install .``. They now need to be installed directly on the worker image with `apt-get` for your Klio job to use.

.. collapsible:: Example of Required Changes

    .. code-block:: diff

        FROM apache/beam_python3.6_sdk:2.24.0

        WORKDIR /usr/src/app

        ENV GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT my-project \
            PYTHONPATH /usr/src/app

        + RUN apt-get update && apt-get install my-package

        RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

        + COPY job-requirements.txt job-requirements.txt
        + RUN pip install -r job-requirements.txt

        COPY __init__.py \
            run.py \
            transforms.py \
        -   job-requirements.txt \
            /usr/src/app/

        - RUN pip install .

Suggested Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a collection of suggested changes to optimize Docker builds by removing no longer used layers and to closer mimic the runtime environment on Dataflow.

.. caution::

    **Most of these changes are incompatible with using setup.py.**

    The following changes will break your job if you return to using ``setup.py`` to package your dependencies. If you choose to switch back, simply undo these deletions.

* **DELETE** lines copying ``MANIFEST.in`` and ``setup.py`` since they are no longer used. If you remove those files from your job directory without also editing your the copy commands out of your Dockerfile, your build will break.
